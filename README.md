Create an interface to book movies.

For one of my classes at Indiana University, our final project was to design an interface which resembled an app used to book movies.  To do this and meet the criteria of the project, we were instructed to create a customer/user interface, as well as an administrative interface.  For the users, they would be able to create accounts while logging in, book movies, view their tickets, view their movie history, delete their account, and sign out.  For the administrative view, the user would have the ability to create new movie screenings, blacklist customer accounts, and edit the details of an existing screening.
